/*
 * 1. Protocol should not use logging mechanism.
 * 2. Protocol should not use direct monitoring (via monitor provider) - instead ICounterBag should be used. 
 * 3. [discard] Methods should not throw exception, except parameters validation, instead of that
 *    they should return error information within prepared result.
 * 4. Protocol methods should not logging counters with out of the scope knowledge e.q. RequestArrived, ResponseStart.
 *    In other words protocol methods should measure performed operation.
 *
 * 5. 2018-11-17: due to pass ICounterBag as method parameter, maybe exceptions should be immediately thrown
 *    and ProtocolResult wrapper is not required anymore
 * 6. 2018-12-11: hydra protocol will not measure size of request neither response
